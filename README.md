Convert an Image to ASCII Art with Python in 5 Steps

I have converted the infamous Lionel Messi's photo possing as a "topo" (mole) during the last worldcup into an ASCII character made image.

I will keep on trying to adjust some parameters in order to get best size and proportion of the image converted. 
If resize is not applied some images may be in such great amount of characters that is not possible to see the image from a computer. 
The reason why the resize function is applied is because of that. You just can simply disable it by going into the Line 13 of main.py file 
and put a sharp (#) before that line to comment it.

A txt example of the image convertion is save inside this repository folder. Also there is the original image that was used for this example.
